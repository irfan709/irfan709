- **Node.js + Express**
- **MongoDB (Mongoose/ORMs)**
- **JWT authentication**
- **Secure RESTful APIs**
- **Middleware, validation, error handling**
- **Deployment with Render or Railway**

These backend skills allow me to create fully custom solutions and integrate them seamlessly with my Flutter apps.
