## 🚀 What I Do

- 🧱 Build **clean, scalable Flutter apps** using modern state management (Provider, Riverpod, Bloc)
- 🧩 Work with **local databases** (Isar, Hive, SQLite) and **real-time services** (Firebase & Supabase)
- 🔐 Implement **secure data handling** using encryption packages
- 📊 Add **interactive charts, analytics, and animations** for rich user experiences
- 🧠 Build **custom REST APIs** with Node.js + Express + MongoDB
- 🛠️ Deploy full-stack solutions using **JWT**, **RBAC**, **file uploads**, and platforms like **Render** or **Railway**

## 🌐 Backend Skills

While Flutter is my primary focus, I’m also experienced in building custom backend services:

- ⚙️ **Node.js + Express** for REST APIs
- 🛢️ **MongoDB** with Mongoose/ORMs
- 🔑 **JWT Authentication** with RBAC
- 🧪 Middleware, input validation, and centralized error handling
- 🚀 Deployment using **Render**, **Railway**, or other cloud platforms

These backend capabilities allow me to create end-to-end solutions and integrate them cleanly with Flutter apps.
